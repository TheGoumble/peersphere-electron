# Peer Sphere

# Abstract
Peer Sphere is a desktop-based application that provides college students with a collaborative study environment tailored to course-specific academic needs. The application will allow users to register and log in, create or join study groups, share and edit notes, generate flashcards, and organize review sessions in a secure and structured interface. The app is intended to simulate a real-time academic support network, allowing students in the same class to collaborate outside the classroom.
